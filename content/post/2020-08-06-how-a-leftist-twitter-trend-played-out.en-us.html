<p>A twitter trend took over on August 4-6th wherein people were dropping the convention of not “following back” people back and essentially following every person using the hashtag #nocomradeunder1k.</p>
<p>I decided to pull out the <code>rtweet</code> package to see how the trend was faring after a day:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtweet)

comrade_df &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#NoComradesUnder1k&quot;,
                            n = 100000, 
                            retryonratelimit = T, 
                            parse = T,
                            include_rts = F)</code></pre>
<p>I had gained quite a few followers (250 in 5 hours vs 500 over multiple years on another account), and was wondering what that twitter network looked like, where people were using the hashtag, and whether or not I could automate a process to give my new followers a gift of their own network / friends (e.g. people who you follow that follow you back).</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that the trend had started noticeably dying off the morning after I saw the trend, which I think is likely due to “follow limits” imposed by twitter which state you can only follow 400 users within a 24hr period.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comrade_df %&gt;%
  ts_plot(&quot;3 hours&quot;) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;)) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = &quot;Frequency of #nocomradesunder1k use&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;n = 45,734 tweets, not including RT, last update Aug. 6th 10AM&quot;,
    caption = &quot;\nSource: Data collected from Twitter&#39;s REST API via rtweet&quot;
  )</code></pre>

<p>I was wondering how I could draft up a network analysis, and the various igraph packages have always looked promising, but a bit complicated. So I took a simpler approach that Bob Rudis created:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rt_g &lt;- my_RTS %&gt;% 
  filter(retweet_count &gt; 20) %&gt;% 
  select(screen_name, mentions_screen_name) %&gt;% 
  unnest(mentions_screen_name) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(mentions_screen_name)) %&gt;% 
  graph_from_data_frame()

V(rt_g)$node_label &lt;- unname(ifelse(degree(rt_g)[V(rt_g)] &gt; 80, names(V(rt_g)), &quot;&quot;)) 
V(rt_g)$node_size &lt;- unname(ifelse(degree(rt_g)[V(rt_g)] &gt; 60, degree(rt_g), 0))

ggraph(rt_g, layout = &#39;linear&#39;, circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_arc(edge_width=0.125, aes(alpha=..index..)) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label=node_label, size=node_size),
                  label.size=0, fill=&quot;#ffffff66&quot;, segment.colour=&quot;green&quot;,
                  color=&quot;slateblue&quot;, repel=T, fontface=&quot;bold&quot;) +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_size_area(trans=&quot;sqrt&quot;) +
  labs(title=&quot;Retweet Relationships&quot;, subtitle=&quot;Most retweeted screen names labeled. Darkers edges == more retweets. Node size == larger degree&quot;) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I can make a similar graph looking at connections between my RTs and people in my network’s RTs, which is less interesting than what I wanted to do, which is to show full network connections. I’m afraid that may not be possible, or at least not quickly. For now, here is the RT graphic:</p>
