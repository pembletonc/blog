Making (PDF) reports iteratively using R is something I've wanted to learn to do for some time. In most cases, clients, colleagues, and managers don't want html files, they want a single, succinct document which is consistently formatted and branded. After running into several roadblocks trying to create an iterative report, I decided to compile the various stackoverflow posts and blogs into one post here going over the basics of ```rmarkdown::render()```, LaTeX, and ```purrr::pmap()```.

Some key things before starting:  

1. Have a good sense of your working directory: There will be multiple moving parts here, an r script, an rmd script / template, images for the pdf, and .tex templates - it's a good idea to have a strong grip of all these elements.
2. Spend some time getting to know markdown, pandoc, LaTeX: RStudio makes it very easy to make beautiful things, so until now I haven't had to learn about them in detail. [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40563479/relationship-between-r-markdown-knitr-pandoc-and-bookdown) gives a good idea as to what's going on in the background. 
3. The YAML header is very sensitive! Everything has to be in it's place, if not, things won't run. Using the ```rmarkdown::render()``` requires a few other steps to be in place in your YAML before it render everything how you want it.

## Setting the styles straight using LaTeX  

Before getting into the iterative functionality of rendering in rmarkdown, it's helpful to have a "template" .Rmd in place first. There are many ways to do this, but I found adding LaTeX right into the YAML header easiest. 

**Tables with KableExtra for LaTeX**  
KableExtra is (IMO) the simplest, most consistent, and best looking table development package for html table creation in rmarkdown. To use it with PDFs, a few extra steps are needed.

First, in the code-chunk: it's pretty much the same as when creating html tables, with the difference of needing to ensure you set the type to "latex", and for text-heavy columns you'll need to specifiy the column width with ```column_spec()```, else the column text will run over the page's width.

For more details on this formatting tables in LaTeX / KableExtra, check this sister reference document to the html version of KableExtra for html tables, Hao Zhu has created a very detailed ["Create Awesome LaTeX Tables with KableExtra(pdf)"](http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf). 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

kable(table, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "50em", border_left = T)
```

Second, in order for the table to be visible, you'll need to adjust the YAML further, directly adding the necessary LaTeX table packages under  ```header-includes```:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
header-includes:
- \usepackage{booktabs}
- \usepackage{longtable}
- \usepackage{array}
- \usepackage{multirow}
- \usepackage[table]{xcolor}
- \usepackage{wrapfig}
- \usepackage{float}
- \usepackage{colortbl}
- \usepackage{pdflscape}
- \usepackage{tabu}
- \usepackage{threeparttable}
- \usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
- \usepackage{fancyhdr}
- \usepackage{graphicx}
- \usepackage{eurosym}
- \usepackage{booktabs,xcolor} 
---
```

**Adding header and footer images**  

A last style point is adding images into the headers and footers. I've used two LaTeX packages for this, ```\fancyhdr``` and ```\wallpaper```. I still haven't worked out how to format the images perfectly, but more or less you link the header/footer images and their setting in the YAML as well under ```header-includes```:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
header-includes:
- \addtolength{\headheight}{1.50cm}
- \rhead{Community Solutions Network One-to-One Advisory Service - \today} 
- \lhead{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{logo_h.jpg}} 
- \setlength\footskip{5pt}
- \LRCornerWallPaper{.50}{footer_logo.jpg}
- \fancypagestyle{plain}{\pagestyle{fancy}}
---
```


## Creating custom reports iteratively  

Now that the template document is structured to produce tables with a bit of header/footer formatting, the next step is creating multiple reports using the template.

### Setting up a parameterized Rmarkdown template

Setting parameters in an RMarkdown is a way of referencing a file or dataset once in the YAML so the text within the script doesn't need to change every time, just the param reference.

For example, here I have two parameters set, one which inserts images from another directory, and another which is a call to a dataset:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

---
title: "Title"
mainfont: Arial
output:
    pdf_document:
      latex_engine: xelatex
      fig_caption: false
      fig_height: 4
geometry: margin=.5in
params:
    images_params: !r list.files(path = "./images/", pattern = "\\.jpg$", full.names = TRUE)
    data: mtcars
---

```

Under ```params:``` setting, !r is used for inline r code within the YAML.
For more information on what YAML settings are availale with ```pdf_output```, check [this rmarkdown guide (pdf)](www.rstudio.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F03%2Frmarkdown-reference.pdf).  


Using parameters in the .Rmd is done by calling params$. within r functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}

#to include the images from the directory:
knitr::include_graphics(params$images_params)

#calling the dataset directly

head(params$data, n = 10)
```

The first ```include_graphics()``` call isn't very useful in its current state for inserting a single image, as it will insert all images within the directory (or whatever line of code is here), but that will come useful later when we need to iterate.

## Setting up the R script  

Once the .Rmd is ready to go, the <20 lines of r script can be written which will do iteration leg work. I've copied it pretty much line for line from [this](https://medium.com/@urban_institute/iterated-fact-sheets-with-r-markdown-d685eb4eafce) helpful script provided by the Urban Institute.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
path <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(
  list.files(path = "./images/",
             pattern = "\\.jpg$",
             full.names = F))

images_params <- list.files(path = "./images/",
                            pattern = "\\.jpg$", 
                            full.names = T)
reports <- tibble(
  output_file = stringr::str_c("score_card_email/", path, ".pdf"),
  params = map(images_params, ~list(images_params = .))
)

#not sure if setting the envir = new.env() is needed, but some feedback on SO gave this solution
reports %>% pwalk(rmarkdown::render, 
                  input = "./Scripts/08 - Questionnaire_Results_Email_Attachment.Rmd",
                  "pdf_document", envir = new.env())
```

What the ```pwalk()``` call with ```render()```  does is renders a new PDF for each item in params list in the dataframe. Pretty easy!
