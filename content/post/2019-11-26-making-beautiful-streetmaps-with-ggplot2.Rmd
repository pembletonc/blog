Since an undergrad I've found it difficult to create a really nice streetmap. They always tend to look cluttered, line widths for different streetypes are always a challenge...the list goes on. I found this [amazing post](https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/) (and site) created by [Christian Burkhart](https://twitter.com/Christi58451746) which gives some great tips on graphic design and data visualization. This post is largely a walk-through of the process he uses.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if(!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load("osmdata", "tidyverse","sf")
```


Following the tutorial, I can extract the data for my city (Montreal) using the ```osmdata``` package:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
mtl_big_streets <- getbb("Montreal, Canada") %>% 
  opq() %>% #querying function
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("motorway","primary",
                  "secondary", "tertiary")) %>%
  osmdata_sf() #returns query as sf type


mtl_small_streets <- 
  getbb("Montreal, Canada") %>% 
  opq() %>% #querying function
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("residential", "living_street",
                                             "unclassified", "service", "footway")) %>%
  osmdata_sf() #returns query as sf type

mtl_river <- 
  getbb("Montreal, Canada") %>% 
  opq() %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "waterway", value = "river") %>%
  osmdata_sf()
```

And can check one of these files out in ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "black",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8)
```

Or all of the layers together, with a white background:

```{r, dpi=500}
mtl_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "steelblue",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_small_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "black", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .6) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_river$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "black",
          size = .2,
          alpha = .5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.97416, -73.47430), 
           ylim = c(45.41008, 45.70479),
           expand = FALSE) 

mtl_map_white <- mtl_map + theme_void()

mtl_map_white
```


Or with black background:


```{r}
mtl_map_black <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#7fc0ff",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_small_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#ffbe7f", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .6) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_river$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#ffbe7f",
          size = .2,
          alpha = .5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.97416, -73.47430), 
           ylim = c(45.41008, 45.70479),
           expand = FALSE) +
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#282828")
        )

mtl_map_black

```

This looks pretty good, but the size of Montreal seems to be bigger than the German city in the tutorial, and the roadways look a bit clustered and it's hard to see what is what exactly unless you're familiar with the city. 

Following the tutorial, I could take an export of these maps and add a border and title in powerpoint, but I think I'd like to increase the scale a bit to a specific part of the city (my neighborhood) to see how that looks.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
mile_end <- 
  getbb("Montreal, Canada") %>% 
  opq() %>% #querying function
  add_osm_feature(key = "admin_level", value = "11") %>%
  osmdata_sf() %>%  #returns query as sf type
  unique_osmdata

mile_end <- mile_end$osm_multipolygons %>% 
  filter(name == "Mile End")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mile_end, #note that no longer need to extract subset
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          fill = NA,
          color = "white",
          size = 1,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#7fc0ff",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_small_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#ffbe7f", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .6) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.6161, -73.5762), 
           ylim = c(45.5312, 45.5146),
           expand = FALSE) +
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#282828")
  )

```


I think that looks far less cluttered than the full-scale city map. Next I'd like to emphasize/accentuate the streets within the neighborhood a bit more. First can test out clipping those roads I want using ```sf_intersect```:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

intersect_big_streets <- st_intersection(mtl_big_streets$osm_lines, mile_end)
intersect_small_streets <- st_intersection(mtl_small_streets$osm_lines, mile_end)

mile_end_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mile_end, #note that no longer need to extract subset
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          fill = NA,
          color = "white",
          size = .8,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#7fc0ff",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_small_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#cc9865", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .6) +
  geom_sf(data = intersect_big_streets,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#cbe5ff",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = intersect_small_streets,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#ffd1a5", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.6161, -73.5762), 
           ylim = c(45.5312, 45.5146),
           expand = FALSE) +
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#282828")
  )

mile_end_map

```

I like that, and think it could be accentuated even more with some building polygons within the neighborhood:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
buildings <- 
  opq(c(-73.6161,45.5312,-73.5762,45.5146)) %>% #querying function from mile end bbox
  add_osm_feature(key = "building", value = c("apartments", "commercial", "church","school",
                                              "civic","house","supermarket","temple","synagogue",
                                              "office","warehouse","mosque","government","university",
                                              "residential", "yes")) %>%
  osmdata_sf() %>%  #returns query as sf type
  unique_osmdata

buildings_mile_end <- st_intersection(buildings$osm_polygons, mile_end)

#note that need to re-add the coord_sf:
mile_end_map <-
  mile_end_map +
  geom_sf(data = buildings_mile_end,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#a4f9f7",
          size = .1,
          alpha = .7,
          fill = "#a4f9f7") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.6161, -73.5762), 
           ylim = c(45.5312, 45.5146),
           expand = FALSE)

```

A last touch would be a title, something that the author of the blog I'm copying did in Powerpoint, but can also be done in R directly using some combo of ```ggforce``` which I haven't quite got the hang of yet...so I've also done it in ppt here with a final exported image (at 800 dpi) included:

![](/img/mile-end-final.png)

With a white background it also looks good, would need a bit more work with post-processing to get to a publishable level, but after running through powerpoint the result isn't terrible either:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_big_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#bfbfbf",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = mtl_small_streets$osm_lines,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#bfbfbf", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .6) +
  geom_sf(data = intersect_big_streets,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#737373",
          size = .4,
          alpha = .8) +
  geom_sf(data = intersect_small_streets,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "#737373", 
          size = .4, 
          alpha = .5) +
  geom_sf(data = buildings_mile_end,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "white",
          size = .1,
          alpha = .7,
          fill = "#737373") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-73.6150, -73.5762), 
           ylim = c(45.5312, 45.5146),
           expand = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
#+
  #theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#282828"))
```

Not bad, I'm colourblind so think that I could definitely play with the colours a bit, but for now, I'm pretty happy with that result! Super easy using the ```osmdata``` package!
